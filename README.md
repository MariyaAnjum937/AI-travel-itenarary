**Your smart AI-powered trip planner — plan less, travel more!**

---

## 🌍 Overview

Planning a multi-day trip can be overwhelming. From finding attractions and restaurants to figuring out travel times and local customs, it often takes hours to organize everything.
**AI-Travel-Assistant** simplifies this entire process by generating a **personalized, day-by-day, time-blocked itinerary** based on your destination, trip duration, and interests — all within seconds.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Our team wanted to solve a common problem that every traveler faces: **information overload**. With so many travel websites, blogs, and reviews, trip planning can feel more stressful than exciting. We wanted to build an app that uses the power of **AI and cloud computing** to make planning smooth, smart, and enjoyable.

## ⚙️ What It Does

AI-Travel-Assistant takes three simple inputs:

1. **Destination City**
2. **Duration (in days)**
3. **Interests** (e.g., *Art Museums, Vegan Food, Hiking*)

It then generates a **day-wise itinerary** that includes:

* Morning, afternoon, and evening activity blocks
* Realistic durations and locations
* Grouped attractions to minimize travel time
* Suggestions for meals, leisure, and rest breaks

Example Output:

```
Day 1:
- Morning: Visit Art Museum (2 hrs) - Downtown
- Afternoon: Lunch at Green Eats (1 hr)
- Evening: Hike at Sunset Trail (3 hrs)
```
